## PLAN:


- Add next to credits the average gpa with a popup for graphs on click
- Need to add loading and ui for professor reviews with an option to filter by class
- need to make the ui for options
- need to publish it after testing
- add counts to GPA and ratings
- add graphs to GPA and ratings
- add summarized ratings




- Later later, add a prefetching functionality to the web server, were it walks the entire of the planet terp and compares it with what we have in cache. It can do, say a professor/class a minute to avoid overloading the api. Then it compares the response with what we have in cache, if it exists and is equal, do nothing, otherwise, overright the cache. We can avoid using cache invalidation timeouts which could make the service feel very slow.
